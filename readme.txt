<!--CPS 630 ASSIGNMENT 2 ITERATION 1: BY AKASH RAI 500763706 & DANIEL BELLISSIMO 500749419 //TEAM 27 -->

We used XML files to save the artist/art information and when a user selects from the drop down menu we used javascript
to search for the art and edit particular HTML elements to display the information. Furthermore we used cookies to save
shopping cart information as well as a modal box overlay to display the information when the user clicks on the title of the art/artist.

Akash did the modal box and the css while I(Daniel) handled the JS and the shopping cart.

The assignment can be accessed through scs.ryerson.ca/~djbellis where it is hosted.
